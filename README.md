## Hi I'm Hemo Fatemi

A fourth year undergraduate **Computer Science** student at **University of Tehran** with a growing focus on cognitive science and computational neuroscience. 

I enjoy exploring ideas at the intersection of brain sciences and computation, and I’m motivated by interdisciplinary research that connects psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.

My goal is to keep learning, building, and working on projects that deepen my understanding of both neural principles and computational methods.
